# LearnASL (SSC 2024)

Check it out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-asl-alphabet/id6479541571?mt=12)

For the Swift Student Challenge 2024, I developed an application for teaching the ASL alphabet by interpreting users’ hand poses. it utilizes Vision, CoreML, AVFoundation, and CoreImage to create a system that reads and classifies users’ hand poses from their device camera. I also designed a CreateML Hand Pose Classification model for detecting ASL alphabet signs.
